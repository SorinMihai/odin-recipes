            <li>1-2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)</li>
            <li>3-4 whole eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>

    <h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.)</p></li>
            <li><p>While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large saut√© pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.</p></li>
            <li><p>In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.</p></li>
            <li><p>Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.</p></li>
            <li><p>Serve at once with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper. If you want, sprinkle with a little fresh chopped parsley.</p></li>
        </ol>
