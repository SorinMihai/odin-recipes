    <p>Maybe what you donâ€™t currently know is that Greece is known for some incredible food that both locals and tourists love to enjoy when residing on one of the islands.</p>

    <p>Greek cuisine, very much like Mediterranean cuisine, is based on olive oil, fresh vegetables, seafood, bread, and wine along with many other ingredients that make this cuisine one of the most delicious in the world. From phyllo dough to Greek yogurt to tzatziki sauce there's a Greek dish for everyone's palate.</p>
    <p>The most characteristic and ancient element of Greek cuisine is olive oil, which is used in most dishes. It is produced from the olive trees prominent throughout the region, and adds to the distinctive taste of Greek food. The olives themselves are also widely eaten. The basic grain in Greece is wheat, though barley is also grown. Important vegetables include tomato, aubergine (eggplant), potato, green beans, okra, green peppers (capsicum), and onions. Honey in Greece is mainly honey from the nectar of fruit trees and citrus trees: lemon, orange, bigarade (bitter orange) trees, thyme honey, and pine honey. Mastic (aromatic, ivory-coloured resin) is grown on the Aegean island of Chios.</p>

    <p>Greek cuisine uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines do, namely oregano, mint, garlic, onion, dill and bay laurel leaves. Other common herbs and spices include basil, thyme and fennel seed. Parsley is also used as a garnish on some dishes. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use "sweet" spices in combination with meat, for example cinnamon, allspice and cloves in stews.</p>
